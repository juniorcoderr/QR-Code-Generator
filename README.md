# QR-Code-Generator
This Node.js application generates a QR code from a user-provided URL. It uses the 'inquirer' npm package to prompt the user for input and the 'qr-image' npm package to generate the QR code image. Additionally, it saves the user input into a text file using Node's native 'fs' module.
