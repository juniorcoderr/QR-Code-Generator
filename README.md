# QR-Code-Generator

Firstly, create a `package.json` file by entering `npm init` in the terminal. This command initializes a new Node.js project and creates a `package.json` file, which will hold the metadata for your project and manage dependencies.

After creating the `package.json` file, install the npm packages `inquirer` and `qr-image`. Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) to find and install the packages.

Next, use my `index.js` code and after writing the JavaScript code go to the terminal and type `node index.js`. This command runs the `index.js` file, which will prompt you to enter a URL. Once you enter the URL, the script will generate a QR code image and save it in the project directory.

Features - 
1) User Input with Inquirer: Prompts the user to enter a URL.
2) QR Code Generation: Converts the entered URL into a QR code image.
3) Save User Input: Stores the entered URL in a text file.

Prerequisites - 
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from nodejs.org.
